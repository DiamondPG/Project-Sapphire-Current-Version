# Project Sapphire

This game is a small backend project of mine. This is to test my backend release techniques and coding techniques. This is not a great game by today's standards, but it has shown me the way to create an installer, check a version, and download an installer from the internet. I have loved this experience and plan to refine my game making skills in future projects.
